# Mental-Health-Diagnosis
This project applies machine learning techniques to assist in mental health diagnosis. Using a dataset of anonymized patient information and symptoms, we've developed models to predict potential mental health conditions.
Key features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning of patient records
Feature engineering to extract relevant diagnostic indicators
Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)
Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
Visualization of results and feature importance
